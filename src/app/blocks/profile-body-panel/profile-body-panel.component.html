<p>Computers have always fascinated me since I was a little boy and also the machines that involve engineering make me
    think in the way how a man can resolve big problems that years ago were impossible to solve.
    I consider myself an introverted and practical person, with a critical and ambitious spirit.
    Studying at FEUP has opened new horizons about Computer Engineering give me tools that allow me to better adapt to
    the business market and to think the better way to resolve problems.
    Through volunteering (G.A.S. Porto) I developed skills such as interpersonal relationships, teamwork, organization
    and problem-solving.
    To improve my self as a software engineer is necessary to cultivate new things that create value in my work, and for
    example, I recently started reading the "Clean Code" by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), one the book that I think that
    all developers should read for improving the development of software and also a clean, organize and simple structure
    of the code. </p>
